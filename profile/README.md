### Motivation
We see the current job market as strongly favoring recruiters with access to AI screening tools, making it particularly difficult for young job seekers to stand out. Many often have to repetitvely fill out hundreds of applications.

Eventually, we hope to make the job search landscape more fun, balanced, and efficient, creating a job market that truly values individual talent and potential. 💪

### Long-term goal 
The long-term vision is to help people navigate the quickly-evolving AI-and-automation driven job market. We strive to bridge the gap between job seekers and their ideal careers, and get people into their best-fitting jobs much faster, making the economy more efficient and ensuring a seamless transition into a rapidly changing, more technologically advanced society. 

Join us on this journey, and let's redefine the way you explore the job market and search for your dream job, together 🌐.
